First of all we need to install Scoop.

Scoop is a command-line package manager for Windows — similar to how Homebrew works on macOS or apt works on Ubuntu.

To install Scoop we open powershell and run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex

Then we use Scoop to install some basic tools:
scoop install git
scoop install python
scoop install neovim

and finally some buckets, like repositories we can draw apps from:
scoop bucket add extras
scoop bucket add nerd-fonts

From the nerd-fonts repository we install the JetBrains Mono Nerd Font:
scoop install JetBrainsMono-NF



Now we can change the terminal setting to give it a more cozy vibe:
we open cmd -> click on the arrow next to the new tab -> settings ->
then the gear at the bottom left that opens the settings.json file

There we delete the settings and copy the ones inside the terrminal_settings.json file.
(be sure the mono fonts in your system and the settings file have the same name)



Then we install fastfetch:
scoop install fastfetch

Next we go to C:\Users\%username% and create a folder named .config which we make hidden
Inside we copy the fastfetch folder
(we make sure that inside the config file in source the path has the correct username)



Now we can enable and disable fastfetch to the cmd using the following commands in powershell:
Run:
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /t REG_SZ /d "cls & fastfetch" /f

Stop Running:
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /f



If we want to use the fastfetch in powershell we need to create a profile running the command:
New-Item -Path $profile.CurrentUserAllHosts -Type File -Force 

The profile settings will be created in documents/windowsPowwershell
we delete the contents and copy the ones inside the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file.
(we make sure that inside the profile file the path that calls fastfetch has the correct username)



Tip:
⚠️ If you get "execution of scripts is disabled on this system" then do this 👇
Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session (Run as Administrator):
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
